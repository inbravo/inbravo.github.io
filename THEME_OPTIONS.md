## How to Apply a Theme

To switch to any of these themes, simply replace the CSS file reference in your HTML files:

### Current (in `index.html`):
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/inbravo.css">
```

### For Dark Theme:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/themes/theme-dark.css">
```

### For Minimal Theme:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/themes/theme-minimal.css">
```

### For Vibrant Theme:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/themes/theme-vibrant.css">
```

### For Monochrome Theme:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/themes/theme-monochrome.css">
```

## Customization

All themes use CSS variables, making it easy to customize colors:

```css
:root {
  --color-primary: #your-color;
  --color-background: #your-background;
  /* etc. */
}
```

---

## Recommendation

Based on the website content (technical documentation and personal reference):

1. **Keep Modern Blue** - Professional, readable, already well-received
2. **Try Dark Mode** - Great for late-night coding/reading sessions
3. **Consider Minimal Green** - If you want a more academic, focused feel

All themes are:
- ✅ Fully responsive
- ✅ Mobile-friendly
- ✅ Accessible
- ✅ Security-hardened
- ✅ Using CSS variables for easy customization

Let me know which theme you'd like to use, or if you'd like any modifications!
